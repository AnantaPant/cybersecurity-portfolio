# Linux File Permissions – Ananta Pant

This folder contains my work related to managing and analyzing Linux file permissions. 
In this project, I practiced using Linux commands to view, modify, and control file 
permissions for users, groups, and others in a secure environment.

## Key Skills Demonstrated
- Understanding read, write, and execute permissions
- Using chmod, chown, and ls -l commands
- Managing ownership and permission sets
- Applying least-privilege concepts
- Working in a command-line environment

## What I Learned
Through this assignment, I gained hands-on experience with how Linux systems handle 
file permissions and why they are important for security. I learned how improper 
permissions can expose sensitive files and how correct configurations protect the system. 
This project helped me understand real-world permission management for cybersecurity.
