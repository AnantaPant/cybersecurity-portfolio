# Network Structure & Security Analysis – Ananta Pant

This folder contains my project on analyzing a network’s structure and identifying potential security issues within it. The goal of this assignment was to understand how networks are organized, how devices communicate, and what vulnerabilities may exist within a typical network environment.

## Key Skills Demonstrated
- Understanding basic network components (routers, switches, firewalls, endpoints)
- Analyzing network diagrams
- Identifying insecure configurations
- Recognizing weak points in network traffic flow
- Evaluating defenses such as segmentation, filtering, and access rules

## What I Learned
Through this project, I gained hands-on experience evaluating how networks operate and how attackers might exploit weak links. I learned how proper network segmentation, monitoring, and secure configuration can prevent unauthorized access and limit the impact of cyber threats. This assignment helped strengthen my foundational knowledge of network security.
