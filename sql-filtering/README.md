# SQL Filtering Project – Ananta Pant

This folder contains my work from the SQL filtering assignment completed in my cybersecurity coursework. The goal of this project was to practice using SQL queries to filter, sort, and analyze data securely and accurately.

## Key Skills Demonstrated
- Using SELECT statements to retrieve data
- Applying WHERE, AND, OR operators for filtering
- Sorting and organizing results using ORDER BY
- Understanding how data filtering is used in real security investigations
- Improving accuracy and precision when searching large datasets

## What I Learned
This project helped me understand how SQL is used in cybersecurity to quickly locate important information inside databases. I learned how proper filtering can reveal suspicious patterns, identify anomalies, and support incident investigations. SQL plays a major role in security analysis, and this assignment strengthened my technical foundation in data retrieval and filtering.
