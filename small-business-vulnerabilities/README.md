# Small Business Vulnerability Report – Ananta Pant

This project focuses on identifying vulnerabilities within a small business environment. I analyzed different parts of a company’s system, policies, and daily operations to understand how weaknesses can expose an organization to security threats.

## Key Skills Demonstrated
- Identifying internal and external vulnerabilities  
- Understanding social engineering risks  
- Reviewing password policies and access management  
- Evaluating physical security weaknesses  
- Recommending improvements to strengthen overall security  

## What I Learned
Through this assignment, I gained experience looking at cybersecurity from a business perspective. I learned how simple issues—such as weak passwords, misplaced documents, or lack of employee training—can create major risks. This project improved my ability to think like a security advisor and suggest realistic solutions to help protect small businesses.
