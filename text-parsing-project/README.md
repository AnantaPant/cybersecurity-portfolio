# Text File Import & Parsing – Ananta Pant

This project demonstrates my ability to process and analyze text data using basic scripting and cybersecurity techniques. The goal of the assignment was to import a text file, extract meaningful information, and interpret the results from a security perspective.

## Key Skills Demonstrated
- Reading and parsing text files
- Identifying patterns in data
- Extracting useful information for security analysis
- Understanding how logs and text outputs are used in cyber investigations

## What I Learned
Through this project, I learned the importance of parsing files in cybersecurity. Many logs, alerts, and threat reports come in plain text format, so knowing how to read and analyze them is essential. This project helped me understand how raw text data can reveal system behavior, suspicious activities, and security issues.
