# Security Audit – Ananta Pant

This security audit project demonstrates my ability to review basic security controls, identify risks, and understand the importance of protecting organizational assets. In this project, I learned how to evaluate key areas such as:

• Physical security
• Administrative controls
• Technical controls
• Access management
• Password policies
• System vulnerabilities

I also practiced identifying weaknesses that could lead to security breaches and documenting risks in a clear and professional way. Completing this project helped me understand how organizations secure their environments and why continuous auditing is important for reducing threats.
