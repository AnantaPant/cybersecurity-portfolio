# Security Audit – Ananta Pant

This folder contains my work related to conducting a basic security audit as part of my cybersecurity coursework. In this project, I learned how to evaluate an organization’s security posture, identify vulnerabilities, and analyze potential risks across systems and processes.

## Key Skills Demonstrated
- Understanding of fundamental security controls
- Identifying strengths and weaknesses in a system
- Basic risk assessment
- Reviewing authentication, authorization, and access controls
- Observing real-world security gaps and suggesting improvements

## What I Learned
Through this assignment, I gained experience analyzing how organizations protect their data and systems. I learned how small vulnerabilities can turn into major security risks and how proper controls, policies, and monitoring help maintain cybersecurity. This project strengthened my ability to think like an auditor and understand what makes an environment secure.
